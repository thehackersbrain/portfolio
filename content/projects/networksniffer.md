A Simple Multithreaded Network Sniffer written in Python. Acts as a bridge and puts itself on the middle of the every connection, sniffs and creates a log of the network traffic going through it, and it also supports the ICMP protocol. Made as a walkthrough project while reading or going through the **BlackHat Python 2nd Edition** Book.
