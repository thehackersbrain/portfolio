The project is a **Chip8** emulator written in the **Rust** programming language. The goal of the project is to learn more about **system programming** and generally how emulators works while learning to program or code in **Rust**. This project includes various aspects of system programming, including **Memory Management**, **CPU Emulation**, and input/output handling. Although, This program was very engaging and challenging project that provides a solid foundation for further exploration in the field of low-level programming.
