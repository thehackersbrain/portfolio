**Hiddenpngpy** is a **Python3** program designed to hide any kind of data inside an image file using encryption and password protection. This program uses any image file as the container and encrypt their data before embedding it inside the image. The program allows users to set a password that is required to extract the hidden data, adding an extra layer of security to the process.
