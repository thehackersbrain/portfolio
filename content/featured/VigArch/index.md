A live and anonymous operating system for hackers, security professionals, and tech geeks. **Vigilante Arch** is the ultimate toolkit for modern-day cyber vigilantes. Built on the robust foundation of Arch Linux. Developing Vigilante Arch provided me with invaluable insights into _OS development_, deepening my understanding of _Linux internals_, _networking_, and _storage systems_. Utilizing _GitHub_ and _Git_ for version control streamlined collaboration, while implementing _CI/CD_ pipelines enhanced the efficiency of publishing and releasing. Additionally, venturing into web development with cutting-edge tech stacks like _ReactJS_ and _NextJS_ enriched my skill set, complementing the project's holistic approach.
